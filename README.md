## 🤖 How to Interact with the Agent

The **ProductivityAgent** is designed to assist with managing your emails, calendar, and tasks. Below are some example queries you can use to interact with the agent:

### Ask about your emails:
You can ask the agent to summarize your recent emails, search emails by keyword, or analyze them for sentiment.

**Example queries:**
- "What are the latest emails about job opportunities?"
- "What are the recent emails about project updates?"

### Manage your calendar:
Create and manage calendar events with custom reminders.

**Example queries:**
- "Schedule a team meeting tomorrow at 2 PM"
- "Set up a reminder for my doctor's appointment next week"

### Request task extraction:
Ask the agent to identify tasks from your emails and generate action items.

**Example queries:**
- "Are there any tasks I need to do today?"
- "What action items are mentioned in the last email?"

### Analyze email sentiment:
The agent can determine if the sentiment in your emails is positive, negative, or neutral.

**Example queries:**
- "What's the sentiment of the last few emails?"
- "Analyze the sentiment of the email from my boss."

### Filter emails:
You can ask the agent to filter emails by specific criteria such as sender, keywords, or date.

**Example queries:**
- "Show me emails from Google."
- "Find emails from March with the word 'urgent'."

## ⚠️ Renewing Google OAuth Credentials (if expired)

If you see errors like "The OAuth client was deleted" or authentication issues with Gmail/Calendar, follow these steps:

1. **Create new credentials in Google Cloud Console:**
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).
   - Select your project or create a new one.
   - Click on "Create credentials" > "OAuth client ID".
   - Choose "Desktop app" as the application type.
   - Download the JSON file.

2. **Update the `oauth_credentials.json` file** in your project root with the new JSON you just downloaded.

3. **Manually delete the `token.pickle` file** (if you don't delete it, the authentication flow will not work with the new client).

4. **Run the token generation script:**
   ```bash
   python test_generate_token.py
   ```
   or any script that uses the AuthManager (for example, `python test_gmail.py`).
   This will open your browser to authorize the app and generate a new valid token.

That's it! Your agent should now authenticate correctly with Google.
